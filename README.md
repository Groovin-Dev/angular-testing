# AngularTesting

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Logging in

To actually login, you will have to bypass CORS somehow. Since this is just for messing around, I used [CORS Unblock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-unblock/lfhmikememgdcahcdlaciloancbhjino) on the chrome store. Once you have done that, just click login in the top right, enter your login info for [Generation Esports](https://generationesports.com) and you should see your token and user data from user/me
